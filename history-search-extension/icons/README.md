# Icon Generation

The extension requires icon files in PNG format at these sizes:
- 16x16 pixels (icon-16.png)
- 32x32 pixels (icon-32.png)
- 48x48 pixels (icon-48.png)
- 96x96 pixels (icon-96.png)

## Option 1: Use the Icon Generator (Recommended)

1. Open `generate-icons.html` in any web browser
2. Click each "Download" button to save the icons
3. Save all four icons in this `icons/` directory
4. Make sure filenames match exactly: `icon-16.png`, `icon-32.png`, etc.

## Option 2: Create Your Own

Create your own icons at the required sizes and save them here with the correct filenames.

## Option 3: Use Placeholders

For testing, you can create simple solid color PNG files at the required sizes. The extension will work without pretty icons, though they won't look great in the toolbar.
